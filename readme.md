# Crank
An extensive HTML5 framework for building robust web sites utilizing Jade, SCSS, and Compass with GruntJS.

Crank provides and you decide what you need, experiment and modify as required.

## Prerequisites
* [Git](http://www.git-scm.org)
* [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org)
* [Ruby](http://www.ruby.org) (on Windows, install with [rubyinstaller](http://www.rubyinstaller.org))
* Ruby Gems: Sass (latest), Compass (1.0.rc.1), Sass-Globbing
* [Bower](http://www.bower.io)

## If you're on Mac...
* I recommend installing Ruby Version Manager (RVM) with AutoLibs enabled so you don't get any conflicts with system Ruby

## If you're on Windows...
* I recommend install Choco so you can have easy access to stuff like Atom
* Always run Powershell as Admin
* Install Git and Node to your PATH

## Quick Start
1. With prerequites installed - open Terminal or Powershell
2. Move to the location you'd like to clone Crank
3. Run "git clone https://github.com/mksanderson/crank"
4. Cd to the Crank directory
5. Run "npm i"
6. Run "bower i"
7. Run "grunt" to build out all files for the first time
8. Run "grunt server" to fire up a server that is accessible on localhost:1337

## Features
* Sass. Includes some ready to go reusable patterns to help you develop your own
* Compass - the best way to implement x-browser compatibility and efficiency
* The best ideas from SMACSS, MVCSS, and OOCSS, BEMS are at use in Beaker
* Live Reload JS snippet so you don't need a browser extension
* Local Connect server set up so you don't need to do anything else but develop
* Configurable. If you need it to include columns for every width, it can, if you want to scale it down, that can be done too!

## Next Steps for Crank
* Build up base JS modules in modular pattern
