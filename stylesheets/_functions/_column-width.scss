//# Column Width
// Used to generate the width of each column for @mixin columns
// $columns accepts the number of columns that will be used in the equation.
// For instance if you input 3 columns that's a 1/3 proportion for each.
// $margins subtract from the total width.
// %percentage is used when you only want a "single column" type. So you set
// $columns to 1 and set your margins and size of that column, for instance 85%
@function column-width($columns,$margins:0,$percentage:0)
	{
		// Set the percentage value, obviously 100
		$total:100;

		// Output for if the $singular argument is parsed as the default 0
		// This occurs when outputting columns that are evenly split
		@if($columns>1)
			{
				@return(unquote(($total - (($columns - 1) * $margins)) / $columns + "%"));
			}

		// Otherwise we output fractional singulars which are percentage values
		// without a complimentary column(s). For instance a singular value of 66.66%
		// can't have an even complimentary column as that would be greater than 100%
		// It's also easier to figure these out fractionally so we allow such a calculation
		// to take place
		@if($columns==1)
			{
				@return(unquote($percentage - $margins + "%"));
			}
